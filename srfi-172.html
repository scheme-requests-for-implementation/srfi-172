<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI provides two libraries for use with R7RS that provide a
way to sandbox the <code>eval</code> procedure to make it safer to use
in evaluating Scheme expressions of doubtful provenance.  The intention
is to call <code>eval</code>, passing it an S-expression representing a
Scheme procedure and the environment defined by one of these libraries.
Since code evaluated by <code>eval</code> runs in a null lexical
environment, the resulting procedure can then be invoked with less
concern about possible side effects.
</p>

<p><b>Use of these libraries does not provide any sort of safety
guarantee.  There are still many loopholes uncaught, including
attempts to process circular structure and over-allocation of memory.
The claim is only that the probability of such an attack is reduced,
not that it is eliminated.
However, using these libraries is a simple provision that is easy to
implement and easy to use.  For higher safety, it can readily be
combined with other provisions.
</b></p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
The Scheme <code>eval</code> procedure, though part of the language
since R5RS and commonplace in Scheme implementations long before that,
has always been considered radically unsafe.  In the R6RS and R7RS,
this is not entirely true.
With the help of the <code>environment</code> procedure,
code can be evaluated in an immutable global environment
containing only specified libraries.  This SRFI provides
two such environments, structured as R6RS or R7RS libraries.
</p>

<p>
The intention is that the programmer call
<code>(eval s (environment '(srfi 172)))</code>,
where <i>s</i> is an S-expression 
representing a procedure (typically a list whose
car is <code>lambda</code> or <code>case-lambda</code>).
The resulting procedure can be called with increased assurance that it
will not gain access to or modify any Scheme object except those that
are reachable from whatever is passed in as an argument.
If <code>(srfi 172 functional)</code>
is passed to <code>eval</code> in place of <code>(srfi 172)</code>,
the procedure most likely cannot mutate anything at all.
</p>

<p>Note that while some I/O operations are provided by these libraries,
the only kinds of ports that can be created are string and
bytevector ports.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

The library <code>(srfi 172)</code> includes the following 287 variables
and syntax keywords from R7RS-small.  They are believed to be safe in the
sense that they cannot affect or be affected by the outside world except
through the arguments passed to them.
</p>
<p>
No distinctions are
made between the individual R7RS-small libraries, though implementations
that lack one or more libraries would have to bind the missing names
to calls on <code>error</code> or <code>syntax-error</code>.
</p>

<p>This SRFI does not require that the procedures and syntax definitions
it exports are exactly the same as those exported by the various R7RS
standard libraries.  In particular, wrappers or alternative versions that
signal errors on implementation-specified behavior are recommended.
</p>

<p>
The library <code>(srfi 172 functional)</code> exports all of
the exports of <code>(srfi 172)</code>
except for:
<ul>
<li>the <code>set!</code> syntax keyword</li>
<li>the 12 procedures whose names end in <code>!</code></li>
<li>the 8 procedures whose names contain <code>port</code></li>
<li>the 7 procedures whose names begin with <code>read</code></li>
<li>the 2 procedures whose names begin with <code>peek</code></li>
<li>the 4 procedures whose names begin with <code>write</code></li>
</ul>
It therefore exports 254 identifiers.
</p>

<p>
A conforming implementation could be created entirely from this
description.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
Implementations of the two libraries for Chibi can be found
in the repository of this SRFI.
They simply import the
<code>(scheme base)</code>,
<code>(scheme char)</code>,
<code>(scheme complex)</code>,
<code>(scheme cxr)</code>,
<code>(scheme inexact)</code>,
<code>(scheme lazy)</code>,
<code>(scheme read)</code>,
and
<code>(scheme write)</code>
libraries, and export the identifiers given above.
</p>
